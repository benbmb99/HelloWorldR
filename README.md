# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a basic HelloWorld program... with a slight twist that makes it a little fun.

As I am learning how to code in R, I thought it would be fun to make an (possibly slightly over-the-top) R "Hello World" program! If you run this in VSCode, it doesn't do as much. If you run it in RStudio, it's a bit more fun. :)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this program, I used both RStudio and VSCode to develop this program.

The programming language that I used was R. The version of R that I used to code this was 4.3.3.
